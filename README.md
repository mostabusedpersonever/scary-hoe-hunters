# Scary hoe hunters

This is my own game (just virtual, not in real life). Hoes are not real life women or prostitutes **of course**.

Thank you Bazz for being there for me as a child.

Let us define the in game entities as maggots (name subject to change).

There are different categories of maggots:
- Young, middle aged, old
- Pregnant
- With children, without children
- Married, non-married
- The way they dress, present themselves, sound like, their height

Create a point system. It is basically all about harming the maggots. More harm = more points = more rewards for you. Like I said. It's just a virtual concept.

System (very simple for now, it is WIP):
- Sneeze
- Cough
- Direct hit
- Toxic smoke
- Cut with poison
- Without poison
- Insults
- Telepathic attacks (if only telepathy worked in real life, right?)
- Follow the maggots around to scare them a bit
- Yell at them
- Stand in their way
- Stare at them to intimidate them
- Music / brainwashing terrorism nearby
- Look at them in disgust
- Stand up when they sit nearby
- Call them the other gender on purpose
- Just walk away when the maggots try to interact with you
- Refuse to acknowledge their existence
- Cut the maggots body parts secretly to get a sample
- Make up crimes, report them for arbitrary reasons, ruin their transportation vehicles (yes! maggots can travel!)

Then make some public websites:
- With daily high scores
- Who won
- Rewards

The more the maggots retaliate: the more damage is inflicted, the more points you get for damage!
